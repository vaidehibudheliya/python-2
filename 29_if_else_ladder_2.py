weight = float(input("Enter your weight in KG."))
print("Enter your height in foot & remaining inches")
foot = int(input("Enter only foot"))
inches = int(input("Enter remaining inches"))

total_inches = (foot * 12) + inches 
meter = total_inches / 39.37
bmi = round(weight / (meter * meter),2)
print(bmi)

if bmi>=25 and bmi<=29.99:
